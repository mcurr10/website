    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>Throughout my college years, I immersed myself in numerous roles 
and experiences. I was an entrepreneurship fellow, a teacher, a tutor, a 
finance intern, a VC fellow, an aspiring founder, a software engineering 
intern, a crypto enthusiast, a botanist, and ultimately, a government 
researcher. Each of these roles imparted valuable skills and unique 
experiences that became integral to my early twenties. Despite these 
enriching opportunities, I often felt overwhelmed, tired, and stressed, 
likely due to the self-imposed pressure to excel in every endeavor.

Even in my personal life, I was constantly rushing, rarely experiencing 
moments of tranquility. There were only two exceptions: the fall semester 
of 2023, when health issues necessitated a withdrawal from in-person 
classes, leading me to pursue online education, and the spring semester, 
which became a period of existential reflection.

A pivotal moment occurred during a session with my math tutor, who 
highlighted the gaps in my knowledge stemming from my diverse interests 
and lack of specialization. She advised me to focus on one thing and excel 
at it. This advice left me contemplating my varied pursuits and 
questioning my true passion. Science has always been my first love, but I 
was uncertain about how to channel this passion into a career.

As I approach my final class and internship, I am determined to answer 
this question for myself. My goal is to embrace stillness, slow down, and 
rediscover the joy in my pursuits.

To support this journey, I plan to use this website as a tool to build 
skills and monitor my progress. This platform will serve as a 
comprehensive repository for my learning experiences, providing a 
structured way to track my development in various areas. By documenting my 
achievements and challenges, I aim to gain deeper insights into my 
strengths and areas for improvement.

Moreover, the website will enable me to set specific, measurable goals and 
timelines for my skill acquisition, ensuring that I remain focused and 
motivated. Through regular updates and reflections, I can maintain a clear 
perspective on my growth and adjust my strategies as needed.

Ultimately, this website will not only help me develop and refine my 
skills but also serve as a testament to my commitment to personal and 
professional growth. By embracing a more mindful approach to my pursuits, 
I hope to find balance and fulfillment in my journey.</p>
